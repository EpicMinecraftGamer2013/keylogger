SIMPLE KEYLOGGER WORKING IN WINDOWS PC.......

This is a Simple Keylogger Made By me in C++ Programming Which Records every Keystroke with Minimal Features.

Developed in C++ programming Language.

It records Every Interrupt Generated by Keyboard.

This is not For Everyday Use to Specific Machine because it Maximizes the CPU usage to Extreme.

This Generates A File 'Record.txt' in specified folder where you store the Program.

In Record.txt your all KeyStrokes are Saved.

It Records keystrokes Until Program is On

 REQUIREMENT :
 
 1. NOTEPAD (Sublime Text, Notepad++ or Something Like that..)
 2. IDE (For C++ programming CodeBlocks, Dev c++ , Eclipse C/C++ , or Something like that...)
 
 Copy and Paste The Code in IDE or Open it With IDE and Simply RUN it and Type anything from Your Keyboard into any Program 
  it would be Recorded into 'Record.txt' which you can View.
  
  There are Several Improvements on which i am working like :
  Email Integration,
  Time Integration,
  Date Integration,
  Multiplatform Deployment.
  etc....
  
  
  Enjoy Having Fun... But Don't be a Badass with it.
